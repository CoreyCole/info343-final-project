Final project for INFO 343 (Client Side Web Development)

We are building a restaurant technology application. It will:
- Open from tapping your phone on a NFC chip, or opening a tinyURL / QR code on the restaurant table
- Also open from searching for restaurant partners on our website
    - View google maps-esque restaurant profiles with top suggested menu items
- Make the restaurant experience less awkward and more efficient
  - Signal for the waitstaff to come to your table for help, drink refills, or the check
  - Order food and drinks directly to your table from the application
- Make the menu more descriptive
  - Detailed information
  - Ingredients
- Instantly push mobile requests to the restaurant tablet interface with Firebase
